3 parts:
- Heuristic Pre-Filter.
  - non AI network to determine whats up with the server,
- Neural Network.
  - fatima's part
- Deep Unfolding as optimization.
  - gowtham's part.

    
1) Prefilter:
GCODE Image.
Binary check with a 3D print.
'Find sections' that are different.

CAMoptics to load G-CODE
no headless CLI screenshot

gcode.ws - not for real photos.

Blender - Automate Blender w/ Python.
will let me know blender + automate image representation.




2) Neural Network:
MobileNetV2 using transfer learning. 
"classify's the project using multiple sets"

3) Deep Unfolding as optimization.
Run optimization on scripts with deep unfolding as the method.
